    <h1>Privacy Policy for Browser Extensions</h1>
    <p>Our browser extensions, including VirusTotal Lookup, do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users.</p>
    <p>Each extension solely accesses URLs, IP addresses, or file hashes that the user selects to perform lookups or checks relevant to its functionality.</p>
    <p>All processing occurs locally within the user’s browser, and no data is sent to external servers except to publicly accessible APIs where applicable, such as VirusTotal’s API for security lookups.</p>
    <p>If an item does not have a result on VirusTotal, users may opt to upload the file or URL to VirusTotal directly. This process is entirely optional and outside the scope of this extension’s functionality.</p>
