    <h1>Privacy Policy for Browser Extensions</h1>
    <p>Our browser extensions do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users.</p>
    <p>Each extension is designed to access specific information—such as URLs, IP addresses, or file hashes—that the user selects within the browser. This information is used solely to perform the lookups or checks necessary for the extension’s functionality. All processing occurs locally within the user’s browser, ensuring that data remains secure and private.</p>
    <p>No data is sent to external servers unless it is essential for the extension’s intended purpose and functionality. In such cases, data may be sent to publicly accessible APIs to provide users with requested information or security checks. These requests are made solely to deliver the extension's core features.</p>
    <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to transparency. If you have any questions about how our extensions handle data, please contact us.</p>
