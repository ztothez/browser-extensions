## 📝 Developer Comments

- **Item Not Found**: If VirusTotal returns "Item not found," this indicates that the IP, domain, URL, or hash has not been previously scanned or cached in VirusTotal’s database. In such cases:
  - Users can manually upload files or submit URLs directly to VirusTotal's website for analysis.
- **No Automatic Scans**: This extension does not automatically scan or upload files to VirusTotal. It provides quick access to existing scan results.
